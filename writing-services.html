        <p>Welcome to Ludus Integritas LLC, the home base and parent company to several ventures. We offer

Whether it’s firearms or accessories for sale, training in how to make holes or patch them, or writing about all the above, Ludus Integritas is a here to serve. The name Ludus Integritas comes from the Roman for school (ludus) and Integritas reflects wholeness or completeness, describing a holistic approach to training.
        <br>
        Also from the Romans comes the phrase “Libens, Volens, Potens!” This was shouted by soldiers
        preparing to enter battle and it indicated that they were Ready, Willing, and Able to do their job. This concept addressed their overall status both mentally and physically.</p>
